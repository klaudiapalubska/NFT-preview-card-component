# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for challenge, full responsive web for any devices. This is a first time when I use preprocessors - Sass and I really like it! Im aware of mistakes in called stuff wit BEM but I realized too late and I was to lazy to change it xD But in my future project I will be more carefull.
